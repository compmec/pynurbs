**compmec-nurbs** is a python object-oriented library with the purpuse of

1. Easy-use
2. Highly reliable
3. Use of custom types

The third point is the main motivation since there are no other libraries which allows use of custom objects like explained here: :ref:`custom-objects`

For example, the [compmec-shape]https://github.com/compmec/shape library uses the custom object ``Point2D`` and fractions to get better precision.
